## Backfill performance notes (2026-06-01)

- **AkShare is the throughput bottleneck, not CPU.** Each call is a
  1-3s HTTP round-trip to Eastmoney, and AkShare has no per-process
  rate limiter. The server side appears to throttle beyond ~8
  concurrent in-flight calls: 16-way concurrency did **not** speed
  up the backfill, only raised the risk of 5xx errors.
- **Sweet spot: `--concurrency 8 --min-interval-seconds 0.1`.**
  ~2.9s per fund with 2-year NAV and include_all, ~96% success rate.
- **Use `--batch-size 100`** for tighter checkpoints. A 200-fund
  batch can take 5-8 minutes, and any single failure costs the whole
  batch in state. 100-fund batches lose at most 100 to a transient
  issue.
- **Currency funds are pure waste for `include_all`.** They have no
  stock/bond/industry holdings, so 80% of the calls return empty
  + a `dataset_errors` row. Always pass `--exclude-type 货币`.
- **Total runtime: ~21h for the full 25,961 non-currency funds.**
  Run under cron supervision (see mavis cron self
  backfill-monitor) so a crash or 24h restart can resume from
  `data/backfill_state.json`.
